# CMPUT 412 Winter 2019 
This repository is a sample of the course work from the CMPUT 412 course offered during the Winter of 2019 at the University of Alberta.

> This course is an experimental inquisition of the fascinating field of mobile robotics. Students will specifically be exposed to basic concepts, models, and algorithms in autonomous navigation of a mobile robot operating in indoor environments. The instruction of the course will be through the Robot Operating System (ROS), which provides libraries and tools to help software developers quickly create robot applications. A mobile robot vehicle will be provided to the students, to conduct real experiments. It is equipped with a range sensor as well as a camera for the robot to perceive its environment and make navigational decisions. The course will be developed incrementally, through demos and competitions. The robot tasks that define the demos and competitions will begin with simple motion control and evolve toward a comprehensive term project involving  robot mapping, localization, path planning, object detection and homing.

## Purpose of This Document
This document is intended to serve as a springboard for you to start your journey with mobile robotics. We will provide you with a few backround concepts, some links to useful resources, and a description of how to get our code up and running. The intended audience of this document is anyone with a passion for robotics and the willingness to learn. Aside from the description of how this package is used, we do not assume that the reader has any backround in robotics concepts or really any other special technical background. When we describe how to setup and use this package we do assume that the reader has access to a [TurtleBot](https://www.turtlebot.com), your have a laptop with a copy of [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) installed, and you are [familiar enough](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) with the Ubuntu operating system to navigate and install software. Let's get started!

## Backgound
Mobile Robotis is an [exciting field](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html) with many [high value applicaitons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMTCMhy_MP4). We will provide a brief overview of some of the fundamental concepts used in the field of mobile robotics in order to get you up to speed.
